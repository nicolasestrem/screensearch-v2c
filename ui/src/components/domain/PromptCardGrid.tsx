// PromptCardGrid — the premade Ask cards (UI_REFERENCE §5, `docs/0.2.0.md` PR6).
// A grid of one-click starting questions; clicking a card fills the Ask input and
// submits it through the existing `ask` flow. Genuinely new in 0.2.0 (the old UI had
// none). Tokens only; each card is a ≥hit-min touch target.

// The five premade cards from UI_REFERENCE §5. The prompt is what gets asked; it reads
// `content_text` like any Ask, so answers are grounded in real captures and cited.
