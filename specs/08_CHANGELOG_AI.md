## <date> — <short title>
- **Change:** what was added/modified.
- **Why:** the reason, tied to a spec section.
- **Verification:** the command run + verbatim result.

## 2026-09-09 — Remove confirmed unused code and dependency declarations

- **Change:** after explicit approval, deleted `ScreenScaffold.tsx`, `IconSearch`,
  `startOfLocalDay`, and `useSetMarkNote`; removed unused workspace `thiserror` and
  OCR's direct `tracing` declaration. Cargo removed only OCR's `tracing` lockfile
  edge. Updated `CHANGELOG.md` and the existing `05`–`07` records.
- **Why:** reference analysis confirmed the UI items have no consumers; dependency
  searches confirmed unused declarations. Prefer deletion over new abstractions;
  retain the `03 §2` module boundary and `UI_REFERENCE §6` typed IPC contract.
- **Verification:** unchanged and post-edit workspace results match by test identity
  and outcome (759 pass, 15 ignored); UI lint/build and its two tests pass. The real
  WinRT OCR test was separately run before/after and passed. Full commands, raw
  result excerpts, parity explanation and local evidence paths are in `05` Pass 1.
  The initial strict UI-byte comparison failed because Tailwind dropped the dead
  scaffold's sole-use utility; the subsequent content comparison reports:

```text
PASS: 32 baseline files and 32 rebuilt files map one-to-one
PASS: 31 files identical after asset-filename reference normalization
PASS: only CSS rule removed: .max-w-5xl{max-width:64rem}
```

- **Not included:** dependency upgrades, new tests/stubs, active hook or layout
  refactors, architecture/schema changes, generated-binding edits, commits, PR,
  remote CI, release or merge. Local verification is not a claim of those actions.

## 2026-09-09 — Package the reviewed cleanup for local testing

- **Change:** produced the optimized x64 application and unsigned NSIS installer
  from the reviewed cleanup branch. Documented the reproducible command, temporary
  signing override, installer size/SHA-256 and verification in `05` Pass 2; updated
  the root changelog. No production source or checked-in build configuration changed.
- **Why:** maintainer requested a real build to test, then explicitly requested
  documentation, commit, push and an open PR. No merge or release authorization.
- **Verification:** root `npm run build -- --ci --no-sign --config` with the external
  local-build JSON configuration exited 0. Verbatim build/artifact excerpts:

```text
    Finished `release` profile [optimized] target(s) in 4m 16s
PASS: installer PE and x64 application artifact verified
PASS: tracked repository diff unchanged by packaging
```

- **Limits:** no installation or application launch. The installer retains the
  existing application identity/version; it is unsigned and is not a published
  updater artifact. Existing local regression and static-review evidence remains
  separate from any subsequent remote CI or PR-review result.
