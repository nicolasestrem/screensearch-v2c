## 2026-06-21 — P0 Scaffold (`p0-scaffold` branch)
- **Change:** Stood up the full workspace scaffold — Cargo workspace; `traits` crate with the six
  `03 §3` contracts + domain/jobs/IPC types; honestly-empty skeleton crates `kernel`, `store`,
  `capture`, `ocr`, `embeddings`, `inference`; `src-tauri` Tauri 2 shell with `ping` /
  `get_readiness` typed commands; React 18 + TS + Vite UI skeleton; `ts-rs` binding generation to
  `ui/src/bindings/`; ESLint flat config with the Rules-of-Hooks gate; `crates/doctor`
  environment smoke-check; `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; generated app icons.
- **Why:** P0 Scaffold per `02 §5` / `04 §3` — establish the modular kernel layout (`03 §2`),
  the typed UI↔core contract (`03 §7`), and CI before any phase that writes data.
- **Decisions / corrections:** ts-rs `i64/u64` forced to TS `number` via per-field
  `#[ts(type="number")]` (env override ignored by ts-rs 10.1) — guarded by a test;
  `export_to = "../../../ui/src/bindings/"` (anchors at source-file dir); provisional defaults for
  the two undocumented `03 §8` vision-schedule keys (see `07` gap #1). No fakes/stubs;
  Windows-native crates left un-`forbid`-ed for the P2/P4 `unsafe` FFI paths.
- **Verification:** `cargo fmt --all -- --check` (exit 0); `cargo clippy --workspace
  --all-targets -- -D warnings` (exit 0); `cargo test --workspace` (28 passed, 0 failed);
  `cargo run -p doctor` (WebView2 OK v149, Vulkan OK, llama-server WARN); `ui npm run build`
  (✓ built) + `npm run lint` (exit 0); `git diff --exit-code ui/src/bindings` (exit 0);
  `npx tauri dev` window observed rendering "Kernel says: pong" + readiness list.
