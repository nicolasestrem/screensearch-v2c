# 02 — Strategic Plan

> **Question this file answers:** *"What should change, and why?"* — the strategy and the phased
> path. **Not** every table/endpoint/env var (that's `03_MASTER_PRODUCTION_SPEC.md`). Builds on
> `01_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.

## 1. Goal & user value

**Goal:** ship a local-first Windows app that turns your screen history into an instantly
searchable, question-answerable memory — **without** the resource drain and fragility that sank
the prior attempt.

**User value:**
- *Recall:* find any moment by **text or meaning** (hybrid search).
- *Answers:* ask questions about what you saw and get **grounded, reasoned** answers.
- *Control:* heavy AI work runs **when you choose** (on-demand / timed / idle), not constantly.
- *Trust:* everything is **local**; no cloud, no default telemetry.

## 2. The core strategic change (the "why")

V1's engines were fine; its **shape** was the problem — a tight *real-time* streaming pipeline
(capture→OCR→embed→vision→index, all live) made it resource-hungry and brittle (one crash took
everything down). **V2c changes the shape, not the engines:**

1. **Capture-cheap, enrich-deferred.** Capture + OCR are the only always-on work and are cheap.
   Everything expensive — embeddings, vision tagging, answers — becomes **durable jobs in a
   SQLite-backed queue**, executed by workers **on-demand / on-timer / when-idle**. This is the
   single most important change: it delivers user resource-control *and* fault isolation *and*
   modularity in one move.
2. **Fault isolation by construction.** The only crash-prone, out-of-process component (the
   llama.cpp inference sidecar) is **bound to the app via a Windows Job Object** so it can never
   orphan; a failed enrichment **job retries** instead of crashing capture.
3. **Modular kernel over ad-hoc channels.** Trait-bounded modules communicate over a typed event
   bus — any module is swappable and testable in isolation.
4. **Tiered models, user-selectable.** Vision and answer each offer **Default / Quality**,
   so users trade footprint vs. quality explicitly (see `00 §E`). *(0.3.0 retired the Beta tier —
   `§5c`; the answer lane's non-Apache Nemotron went with it.)*

## 3. What stays vs. changes (vs. the V1 reference baseline)

| Area | V1 (reference) | V2c |
|---|---|---|
| Engines | SQLite+FTS5+sqlite-vec, WinRT OCR, fastembed, llama.cpp | **Keep** (proven) |
| Processing | real-time streaming pipeline | **Change → enrich-deferred job queue** |
| Vision | per-frame, real-time | **Change → on-demand / timed** |
| Shell/IPC | Axum localhost HTTP + rust-embed | **Change → Tauri 2 typed IPC** |
| Structure | monolith, ad-hoc channels | **Change → modular kernel + event bus** |
| ML runtime | flirted with Python ML sidecar (failed) | **Rust-only runtime** (no Python *ML sidecar*; Python OK for tooling) |
| Models | single defaults | **Change → 2-tier per lane** (Default / Quality; 0.3.0 retired Beta) |
| Automation | present | **Drop for v1.0** (later) |

## 4. Future-state architecture (high level)

```
Tauri 2 app  ──typed IPC──  Rust kernel (event bus + trait modules)
   │                              │
   │   always-on (cheap):  WGC capture → WinRT OCR → Store
   │   deferred (controlled):  SQLite JobQueue → workers:
   │        • fastembed (text vectors, in-process)
   │        • llama.cpp sidecar (vision tag / RAG answer, Job-Object-bound)
   │   query:  FTS5 + vec KNN → RRF → (sidecar answer, thinking) → stream to UI
```

Detailed schema, traits, command/event contracts, and sidecar protocol live in `03`.

## 5. Delivery phases (correctness-first; no deadline)

- **P0 — Scaffold:** Tauri 2 + Cargo workspace (`kernel`, `traits`, module crates), `ts-rs`
  binding gen, CI skeleton, WebView2/Vulkan/llama smoke-check.
- **P1 — Data spine:** `Store` + `JobQueue` on SQLite + sqlite-vec + FTS5; schema + migrations;
  RRF retrieval. *Everything writes here.*
- **P2 — Capture happy path:** WGC capture + WinRT OCR (STA) + event bus → frames+text stored;
  live timeline in the UI. *Proves the kernel.*
- **P3 — Deferred enrichment:** embedding worker (fastembed) + job scheduling
  (on-demand/timer/idle); hybrid search end-to-end.
- **P4 — Inference sidecar:** Job-Object lifecycle (spawn/reap/heartbeat/evict), model-agnostic
  tiered loader; on-demand/timed **vision tagging** + **RAG answers** (thinking).
- **P5 — Product:** Command-Deck UI polish; settings (model tiers, schedules, retention);
  packaging (**NSIS** installer; signing pending); first release.
- **Later (nice-to-haves):** multi-model routing UI, timeline analytics, export, sharing,
  auto-update (promoted into the 0.3.2 arc — `§8`, `docs/0.3.2.md`), OS automation.

## 5b. Post-1.0 arc — 0.2.x (attention-first text signal + recall workflows)

P0–P5 (v1.0) are complete and merged; the 0.2.x line is a **separate arc** layered on the shipped
app, **not** a retrofit of the v1.0 phases above. It is tracked in detail in `docs/0.2.0.md`
(roadmap) and `03` (contract); this section states only the strategic *what/why*.

- **The problem.** Capture indexes **raw full-screen OCR with no filtering**, so search, Ask, and
  embeddings get dominated by static chrome — taskbars, desktop icons, browser toolbars, even the
  app's own sidebar labels. Searching "Firefox" / "Steam" / "Deck" surfaces frames purely because
  those labels were on screen, not because they were the user's actual work.
- **P6 — Attention-first text signal + recall workflows.** Preserve raw text, but derive a default
  **content-text** layer (filtered OCR/UIA text — *not* vision descriptions) and make search, Ask,
  embeddings, and reports use it by default. Raw / app-chrome text stays searchable **opt-in**
  (`include_chrome`); default search stays **hybrid (FTS + vector) over content text** and the FTS
  fallback is never removed. Adds Recall **reports** (daily/weekly/custom) and premade Ask cards on
  top of the cleaned signal.
- **Ships in 0.2.0** (clean DB, no backfill): PR1 specs → PR2 data model + OCR spans → PR3
  attention-first filtering → PR6 reports → PR7 audit.
- **Deferred to 0.2.1** (highest-risk, most-invasive, not needed for the retrieval fix):
  event-driven capture, UIA text, and a smart enrichment throttle — each its own gated PR, recorded
  in `07`. **0.2.0 keeps timer/idle capture; no raw keystrokes or clipboard text are ever stored.**
- **Realized on 0.2.1.** The **smart enrichment throttle** (the roadmap's former PR5, `07` gap #49)
  now ships on the 0.2.1 line: opt-in, default-OFF, CPU/GPU-pressure-aware backpressure that pauses
  heavy enrichment (`vision_tag` — and `embed_image` until 0.3.0 PR4 removed that lane — and at the
  deepest level floors `embed_text` concurrency) under *sustained* load, while **capture / OCR /
  storage never pause** (they sit outside the worker pool). Contract in `03 §5/§7/§8`.

## 5c. Post-1.0 arc — 0.3.0 (subtraction + flow recall + open surface)

The 0.2.x line is shipped and tagged; **0.3.0 (P7)** is the next **separate arc** layered on the
shipped app, **not** a retrofit of the phases above. It is tracked in detail in `docs/0.3.0.md`
(roadmap) and `03` (contract); this section states only the strategic *what/why*.

- **The problem.** Two forces, pulling the same way. (1) **Too much surface for a solo project to
  carry** — six event-capture triggers (two riding a global `WH_MOUSE_LL` mouse hook the 0.2.0
  roadmap deliberately avoided), three model tiers per lane (one, Nemotron, the only non-Apache
  license and the only unproven hybrid arch), and a dark, flag-off image-embedding lane
  (`enrich.image_embeddings`) nobody turns on. Each is user config surface, maintainer decision
  surface, and audit surface for a privacy-first product. (2) **Recall is still friction-gated** —
  recalling means switching *to* ScreenSearch, a context switch to recover from a context switch;
  and the app is a silo with no API for the open-source audience to build on.
- **P7 — Surface reduction + flow recall + local API.** **Subtract:** cut the six triggers to
  **foreground + idle** (deleting the mouse hook, the clipboard listener, and typing-pause), retire
  the **Beta** model tier (Default/Quality only — a uniformly Apache story), and remove the
  image-embedding lane (text embeddings + vision tags already cover semantic reach). **Add** — each
  reusing infrastructure that already exists (the store, hybrid search, the sidecar, the capture
  pipeline; no new subsystem is invented): a **global-hotkey Flow overlay** (instant
  search-as-you-type / ask over whatever you're doing), a **where-was-i + mark-this-moment**
  workflow (the ADHD core — pull-based, never nagging), and an **opt-in localhost HTTP API +
  export** with a thin **stdio MCP wrapper**. Every removal deletes a decision; every addition
  reuses infrastructure.
- **Ships in 0.3.0** (build order): PR1 specs → PR2 trigger trim → PR3 Beta-tier removal → PR4
  image-lane removal → PR5 Flow overlay → PR6 where-was-i + marks → PR7 local API + export → PR8
  MCP server → PR9 audit + release. The three subtractions (PR2–PR4) are independent of each other
  and of PR5–PR8; PR5 precedes the overlay half of PR6; PR7 precedes PR8. Existing DBs are
  supported — migrations are forward-only and destroy **only** derived, re-derivable data
  (image-embedding vectors and dead jobs).
- **Deferred (recorded in `07` during PR1, not built this arc):** audio capture / transcription
  (the most-requested capability in the category — a full arc of its own; revisit 0.4.x), a
  custom-GGUF "bring-your-own-model" path (replaces the Beta tier for tinkerers), **proactive
  nudges** (0.3.0's surfaces are **pull-based only** — no notifications, no shame-analytics), marks
  inside Recall reports, and API write scopes beyond `POST /v1/marks`.

## 6. Risks & mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Tauri 2 + WebView2 packaging friction (new) | Spike in P0; keep the shell thin; the kernel is shell-agnostic behind traits. |
| WGC capture integration (new code path) | `CaptureSource` trait + an early P2 spike; fall back to a simpler capture if WGC misbehaves. |
| Sidecar orphan/hang | Job Object KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE + startup reap + heartbeat/restart (hard requirement). |
| Resource spikes surprising users | On-demand/timed by default; explicit schedule UI; idle-only option; per-job budgets. |
| Global hotkey conflicts (PowerToys, IMEs, games) — 0.3.0 | Non-default combos (`Ctrl+Alt+Z` / `Ctrl+Alt+M`), both configurable; a failed registration is a **visible Settings warning + toast**, never a silent no-op (`§5c`; `03 §7b`/§8). |
| API token leakage → full-history read by local malware — 0.3.0 | API **off by default**, binds `127.0.0.1` only (hard-coded, not a setting); plain-language threat model in Settings + docs; a regenerate-token button (`03 §7c`). |
| Scope creep | Automation + nice-to-haves are explicitly **out of v1.0**. |

## 7. Non-goals (reaffirmed)
macOS/Linux · OS automation (v1.0) · cloud/telemetry · accounts/multi-user · real-time vision ·
V1 data import · **proactive nudges / notifications** (0.3.0 recall is pull-based only) · **audio
capture / transcription** (*for now* — a 0.4.x candidate, `§5c`).

## 8. Status
- **License decided: MIT.** No open strategic questions.
- **v1.0 (P0–P5) shipped** (`v0.1.0`, 2026-06-24); the **0.2.x arc shipped** (attention-first text
  signal + recall workflows; `§5b`, `docs/0.2.0.md`); the **0.3.0 arc (P7) shipped** (`v0.3.0`,
  2026-07-04; `§5c`, `docs/0.3.0.md`) and its **0.3.1 triage patch shipped** (`v0.3.1`,
  2026-07-05; `docs/0.3.1.md` — the #64 vision-throughput fix + polish). The **0.3.2 arc is now
  active** — "P7.2 product shell mini-arc" (`docs/0.3.2.md`): **lifecycle** (auto-update,
  hard-sequenced before 0.4.0; systray + quick actions) **and interface** (shell-layout hardening;
  Settings two-tier IA), under a **zero-DB-schema-migration** constraint. Then the **0.4.0 sessions
  arc**.
