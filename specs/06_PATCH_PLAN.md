# 06 — Patch Plan

> **Ordered fixes required before shipping**, plus any **spec contradictions** found during the
> build (`04 §5`). Empty until the build surfaces something.

| # | Priority | Issue | Source (spec §, file:line) | Fix | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 15 | P5 | **Upstream llama.cpp multimodal host-memory leak (build 9842).** ~149 MB committed host RAM leaked per vision inference; VRAM flat. Mitigated locally by the `sidecar.recycle_*` valve (recycle at a committed-RAM ceiling). Real fix requires a newer bundled `llama-server` build. | `07` #72; `specs/03_MASTER_PRODUCTION_SPEC.md §8`; `crates/inference` sidecar lifecycle | **Open (upstream).** Local mitigation shipped (`sidecar.recycle_enabled` default true, `sidecar.recycle_rss_mb` default 0=auto). Upgrade the bundled llama-server build when a fix lands upstream; re-run the 60-frame isolated test to confirm RSS stays flat. | open (upstream) |
| 23 | P3 | **PDH `\GPU Engine(*)\Utilization Percentage` is blind to the sidecar's Vulkan compute** on this NVIDIA box: ~1–2 % summed across all engines while `nvidia-smi` reads 80–100 % during vision inference. `crates/sysmon`'s GPU pressure probe uses exactly these counters, so the 0.2.1 enrichment throttle's GPU arm (`throttle.gpu_enter_pct`) can never engage for the workload it was built to throttle — `gpu_monitored=true` yet effectively unmonitored. CPU arm unaffected. Found while profiling `05` Pass 3 (v0.3.1 archive). | `crates/sysmon` (PDH probe); `03 §5` (throttle contract) | Not a 0.3.1 item (no new subsystems — D8). Future arc: NVML-based probe or per-`engtype` counter audit on Vulkan workloads. | open |

When the spec contradicts itself, stop, ask the user, and log the resolution here before coding.
