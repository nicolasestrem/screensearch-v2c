//! `uia` — [`traits::OcrProvider`] backed by Windows **UI Automation** (`docs/0.2.0.md`
//! #48). It reads the *foreground/target window's* accessibility text — more structured
//! and higher-fidelity than full-screen OCR — and returns it through the same
//! [`OcrResult`] contract OCR uses, so the capture loop, the PR3 text filter, embeddings,
//! and retrieval all flow unchanged. Spans are tagged `source = TextSource::Uia` and
//! `role = TextRole::Unknown` (PR3 classifies roles); `engine = "uia"` lets the store set
//! `frame_text.primary_source = 'uia'`.
//!
//! ## Threading
//! UI Automation is COM and free-threaded; Microsoft recommends an **MTA**. A dedicated
//! long-lived worker thread ([`worker`]) owns the `IUIAutomation` instance under
//! `COINIT_MULTITHREADED`; [`UiaTextProvider::recognize`] dispatches plain `Send` data to
//! it over a channel (no COM pointer ever crosses a thread boundary) and enforces a hard
//! timeout against a wedged worker.
//!
//! ## Fallback (in the composition root, not here)
//! This crate is the **primary** UIA provider only. The OCR fallback is composed in
//! `src-tauri` (the only place that may wire two concrete impls, `03 §2`): when UIA errors,
//! exceeds its latency budget, or yields too little text, `recognize` returns `Err` and the
//! composite falls back to OCR for that frame.
//!
//! ## Privacy
//! UIA reads the on-screen accessibility text of the target window — the same privacy class
//! as OCR. Two UIA-specific guards in [`worker`]: password fields (`CurrentIsPassword`) are
//! never read, and offscreen/occluded elements (`CurrentIsOffscreen`) plus spans outside
//! the target-window rect are dropped, preserving OCR's "only what was visible" parity.
//!
//! Windows-only by design — no cross-platform fallback (`04` guardrails).
