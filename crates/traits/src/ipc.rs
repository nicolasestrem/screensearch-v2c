//! Typed UI ↔ core contract: command inputs/outputs and event payloads (`03 §7`).
//!
//! Every type here derives [`ts_rs::TS`] and exports to `ui/src/bindings/`, so the
//! UI consumes generated types only — never a hand-written duplicate (no contract
//! drift, `04` UI guardrails).
//!
//! **Convention:** every `i64`/`u64` field carries `#[ts(type = "number")]`. Tauri
//! serializes over serde_json where 64-bit ints become JS `number`, so the bindings
//! must say `number`, not ts-rs's default `bigint`. Frame ids and unix-ms timestamps
//! stay well under 2^53, so there is no precision loss. (`03 §7`.)
