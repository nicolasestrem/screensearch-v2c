//! Timer + idle producers for deferred vision tagging (`03 §5`). Vision is **never**
//! real-time: `vision_tag` jobs are only enqueued on a user-configured timer or when
//! the OS reports the user idle past a threshold — both opt-in, off by default
//! (`06_PATCH_PLAN`, `07` gap #1). On-demand tagging goes through
//! [`crate::Kernel::enqueue_vision`] instead.
//!
//! Each enabled trigger enqueues up to `enrich.vision_batch_size` still-untagged frames
//! per tick. A frame that already has an in-flight (`pending`/`running`) `vision_tag`
//! job is skipped — [`Store::untagged_frame_ids`] excludes it — so a slow batch is not
//! re-enqueued on the next tick and the timer/idle lanes don't double-queue the same
//! frames. (`insert_vision` is still an idempotent upsert, so a stray re-analyze after a
//! job leaves the queue can't corrupt data.)
